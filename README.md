# What the Matter?

## Blocks of matter
1. Red Matter
2. Gray Matter

* Red matter is based on red crystal from the old SCP mod. It will grow infinitely but can be stopped and contained using...walls

* Gray matter is a block that can destroy your world and can't be stopped no matter (ba dum tss) what blocks are in its way

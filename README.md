# What the Matter?

## Blocks of matter
1. Red Matter
2. Gray Matter
3. Orange Matter
4. Blue Matter

* Red matter is based on red crystal from the old SCP mod. It will grow infinitely but can be stopped and contained using...walls

* Gray matter is a block that can destroy your world and can't be stopped no matter (ba dum tss) what blocks are in its way

* Orange matter is a block that will glow horizontally and transform into lava and can fill infinite sized areas. Works like old lava block

* Blue matter is a block that will glow horizontally and transform into water and can fill infinite sized areas. Works like old water block
